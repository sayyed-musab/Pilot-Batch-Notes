### What is HTML and Its Role in Web Development

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage, allowing web browsers to interpret and display content like text, images, and links. HTML is essential for web development as it forms the backbone of web pages, working in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

### Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document typically consists of the following basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: The root element that contains all other HTML elements.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as its title and links to stylesheets.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document, such as text, images, and links.

### Common Tags

- `<html>`: Root element of an HTML document.
- `<head>`: Container for meta-information and links to external resources.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page.
- `<body>`: Contains the main content of the web page.
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Header tags, with `<h1>` being the highest (or most important) level and `<h6>` the lowest.
- `<p>`: Paragraph tag used to define blocks of text.
- `<a>`: Anchor tag used to create hyperlinks.
- `<img>`: Image tag used to embed images in a web page.

## Practice Assignment

### Assignment 1: Create a Simple HTML Page with a Title and a Header

### Assignment 2: Add a Paragraph Describing Yourself

Extend the HTML file from Assignment 1 to include a paragraph.

### Assignment 3: Insert an Image and a Hyperlink

Further extend the HTML file to include an image and a hyperlink.

By completing these assignments, you will have created a basic HTML page with a title, a header, a paragraph, an image, and a hyperlink. This foundational knowledge is essential for building more complex web pages in the future.
